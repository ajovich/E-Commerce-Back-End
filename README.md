# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

* An E-Commerce back end application that builds upon starter code, and utilizes Express.js API, and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Usage

* Please ensure prior to application use, you have [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) in order to test the API routes. 

* Clone this repository to your local machine, 

* Open the .env.EXAMPLE file and add your own credentials (username and password) to the empty .env file in the root directory,

* Copy the database schema and run in MySQL workbench,

* In your terminal run npm i, npm run watch, npm run seed,

* Run the CRUD operators (GET, PUSH, PUT, DELETE) for each API route in Insomnia
